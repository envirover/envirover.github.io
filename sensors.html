<h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-12">Supported Sensors and Actuators</h3>
<p>Autopilot of the <a href="usvs.html">USVs</a> uses multiple on-board sensors, including GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, anemometer, thermometer, and barometer.</p>
<p>In adition, up to 30 lbs. of mission-dependent load such as sonars, hydrophones, water and air quality sensors, and sensors supported by <a href="https://www.campbellsci.com/dataloggers">Campbell Scientific dataloggers</a>. On the platforms could also be mounted actuators, such as winches or gimbals.</p>
<p>The sensors and actuators are powered by the on-board 12v power supply.</p>
<p>Data streams from the sensors are recorded by the platform and periodically transfered to the datastore through the satellite link.</p>
