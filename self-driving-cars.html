	<h1>Connecting Self-Driving Cars to Clouds</h1>

	<p>
	   Self-driving cars are just around the corner. Remote tracking, command, 
	   and control links for autonomous cars will enable a wide range 
	   of fleet management applications.</p>
	
	<p>
	   Envirover is developing satellite telemetry systems for self-driving cars 
	   controlled by <a href="http://apollo.auto/">Apollo</a> self-driving open software platform.
	</p>
	
	<p>The telemetry systems work two ways:</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>Sending data from the vehicles to infrastructure for tracking, observation, and monitoring.</li>
	 <li>Sending data from infrastructure to the vehicles providing command, control, 
	     and situation awareness services for the vehicles.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	   Satellite communication is relatively expensive, has low bandwidth, and varying signal quality. 
	   The telemetry systems use data filtering, compression, caching and other means to 
	   minimize and optimize utilization of the communication channels.
