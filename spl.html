    <h1>SPL Global Telemetry</h1>
	
	<p>SPL is a global satellite telemetry system for autonomous vehicles controlled by 
	<a href="http://ardupilot.org/">ArduPilot</a> or <a href="http://px4.io/">PX4</a> autopilots.</p> 
	
	<p>With SPL you can track, command, and control your solar powered boats, planes, blimps, 
	and other autonomous vehicle from the other side of the Earth using <a
		href="http://ardupilot.org/planner/">Mission Planner</a> or <a
		href="http://qgroundcontrol.com/">QGroundControl</a> ground control stations.</p>

	<p>SPL supports wireless TCP/IP Internet connections and Iridium short burst data (ISBD) 
	   satellite communication technology provided by <a href="http://www.rock7mobile.com/products-rockblock">Rock Seven Mobile</a>.
 
 	<div class="w3-example">ISBD is a high latency, low bandwidth messaging technology, yet
		it is relatively inexpensive compared to other global communication
		solutions. The required hardware is very compact and lightweight.</div>    
    
    <p>Not only does SPL transmit messages between autopilot and ground control stations, 
    it also filters messages, buffers, and compresses data to adapt MAVLink protocol for high latency ISBD communication.</p>

    <p>SPL also stores the transmitted messages in a persistent store and provides access to the stored data via web service.</p>
		
	<p>See <a href="http://envirover.com/docs/spl.html">Envirover docs</a> for the instructions on SPL installation and operation.</p>
