	<p>
		SPL is an open global satellite telemetry system for autonomous vehicles
		controlled by <a href="http://ardupilot.org/">ArduPilot</a> or <a
			href="http://px4.io/">PX4</a> autopilots that uses Iridium short
		burst data (ISBD) satellite communication technology provided by <a
			href="http://www.rock7mobile.com/products-rockblock">Rock Seven
			Mobile</a>.
	</p>

	<p>With SPL you can track, command, and control your solar powered
		boats, planes, blimps, and other autonomous vehicle from the other
		side of the Earth.</p>
		
	<p>ISBD is a high latency, low bandwidth messaging technology, yet
		it is relatively inexpensive compared to other global communication
		solutions. The required hardware is very compact and lightweight.</p>

	<p>SPL works with popular ground control stations such as <a
		href="http://ardupilot.org/planner/">Mission Planner</a>, <a
		href="http://qgroundcontrol.com/">QGroundControl</a>.</p>
		
	<p>See <a href="http://envirover.com/docs/spl.html">Envirover docs</a> for the instructions on SPL installation and operation.</p>
