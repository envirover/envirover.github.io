	<p>Smart devices, smart homes, smart cities,..., and finally a
		smart planet.</p>
	<p>To be â€œsmart,â€� the planet would certainly need a brain or two.
		To make smart decisions and turn them into smart actions, the brain
		will need to know whatâ€™s going on. Even a very smart brain is
		useless without a system that collects sensory information about the
		environment and transmits â€œaction itemsâ€� from the brain to the
		muscles that actually do the work.</p>
	<p>Remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery, are
		similar to vision in a biological nervous system. These technologies
		provide a wealth of data about the planet, but, in many cases,
		sensors must be â€œthereâ€� and must interact with the environment to
		make measurements. In addition to vision, the planet needs
		fingertips that are able to touch and scratch the surface.</p>

		<b>GeoNeurons and USVs are like fingertips used to touch and

	<p>Enviroverâ€™s <a href="platforms.html#stationary_platform">GeoNeuron</a> is a device that functions like a
		biological neuron in that it exchanges information between sensors,
		actuators, and a <a href="mission-control.html">data processing system</a>.</p>
	<p>GeoNeuron has two sets of registers, i.e., input registers and
		output registers. Input registers maintain the current state of
		connected sensors. Output registers keep the desired state of
		actuators (i.e., servos that control gymbals, winches, or sampling
		devices). During communication sessions, the content of the input
		registers is sent to the device â€œshadowâ€� in the communication
		medium, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot">Amazon Web Services Internet of Things (AWS IoT)</a>,
		and the content of the output registers is received from the same
		source.</p>
	<p>Out of the box, GeoNeuron supports several types of water and
		air-quality <a href="sensors.html">sensors</a>. It also supports integration with <a href="https://www.campbellsci.com/dataloggers">Campbell
		Scientific dataloggers</a>, which can read a wide variety of measurement
		sensors.</p>
	<p>GeoNeuron uses the <a href="https://www.iridium.com/services/details/iridium-sbd">Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD)</a> satellite
		network for communication with the Internet. The Iridium SBD network
		was not designed to transmit large datasets, such as pictures or
		videos; rather, it is a simple and efficient network that provides
		the capability of transmitting short data messages, providing global coverage.</p>
	<div

		<b>AWS IoT is the spinal cord of the planetâ€™s nervous system.</b>
		<img src="images/iot.png" alt="AWS IoT" style="width: 100%" />
	</div>
	<p>The AWS IoT communication medium is analogous to the spinal
		cord in a nervous system. It is used to exchange information between
		the â€œbrainâ€� and GeoNeurons, and it also triggers alerts, logs data,
		and routes the information flow in the system.</p>
	<p>Sometimes getting â€œthereâ€� requires too much time and money.
		And sometimes, it is not even know where the â€œthereâ€� actually is.
		This is when unmanned vehicles come into play.</p>
	<p>Enviroverâ€™s <a href="platforms.html#raider_2">unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)</a> and other mobile
		platforms are essentially GeoNeurons with propulsion and steering.
		These platforms have a guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C)
		system that also is known as â€˜autopilot.â€™ Autopilot obtains the
		actual position, orientation, and velocity from the GPS,
		magnetometer, and inertial measurement unit, respectively, and
		controls the propulsion and steering to move to the desired point,
		follow the desired path, or â€œscanâ€� the desired area. The autopilot
		also can perform sensor-based guidance, e.g., it can find places
		with the smallest/greatest readings of a certain sensor by using
		gradient-descent search.</p>
	<p>Multiple GeoNeurons or mobile platforms distributed over a
		certain area can be used to solve complex, data-collection problems.</p>

		<b>ArcGIS is the brain of the planetâ€™s nervous system.</b>
		<img src="images/arcgis.jpg" alt="ArcGIS" style="width: 100%" />
	</div>
	<p>The actual and desired states of GeoNeurons and mobile
		platforms can be synchronized with spatial databases in geographic
		information systems (GISs) on the web, such as <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html">ArcGIS Online</a> or
		<a href="http://www.esri.com/en/arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/Overview">ArcGIS Enterprise</a>. The desired states of the devices can be changed
		by simply changing the attributes in a table. GIS can be used to
		store, visualize, and analyze the collected data and to control the
		data â€œcollectorsâ€� with complex orchestration.</p>
	<p>In Envirover, we assess new ways of exploring our planet.
		Enviroverâ€™s mission is to make our planet smarter by providing
		next-generation, environmental intelligence solutions.</p>
