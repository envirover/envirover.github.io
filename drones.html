	<h1>BVLOS Telemetry for Drones</h1>

	<p>
	   Beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) tracking, command, and control increases operational safety and extends potential applications of
	   unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

   <p>
      SPL and NVI system support UAVs controlled by Copter and Plane profiles of 
		<a href="http://ardupilot.org/">ArduPilot</a> autopilot. Support for DJI Matrice drones is coming soon.

	<p>
		<a href="spl.html">SPL</a> is an open-source global satellite
		telemetry system for autonomous vehicles that uses Iridium Short Burst
		Data (ISBD). 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<a href="nvi.html">NVI</a> Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) telemetry system is designed to work with
		satellite or cellular modems such as <a	href="https://www.iridium.com/products/details/iridiumgo">Iridium GO!</a> or 
		<a href="https://www.iridium.com/network/iridiumcertus/">Iridium Certus</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>Satellite communication is relatively expensive, has low bandwidth, and varying signal quality. 
	   SPL and NVI telemetry systems use data filtering, compression, caching and other means to 
	   minimize and optimize utilization of the communication channel.
