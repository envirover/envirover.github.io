			<p>Smart devices, smart homes, smart cities,..., and finally a
				smart planet.</p>
			<p>To be “smart,” the planet would certainly need a brain or two.
				To make smart decisions and turn them into smart actions, the brain
				will need to know what’s going on. Even a very smart brain is
				useless without a system that collects sensory information about the
				environment and transmits “action items” from the brain to the
				muscles that actually do the work.</p>
			<p>Remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery, are
				similar to vision in a biological nervous system. These technologies
				provide a wealth of data about the planet, but, in many cases,
				sensors must be “there” and must interact with the environment to
				make measurements. In addition to vision, the planet needs
				fingertips that are able to touch and scratch the surface.</p>
			<div
				class="w3-third w3-margin-right w3-padding-left w3-padding-top w3-padding-bottom w3-padding-right w3-left w3-border-grey">
				<b>GeoNeurons and USVs are like fingertips used to touch and
					scratch the planet’s surface.</b>

			</div>
			<p>Envirover’s <a href="platforms.html#stationary_platform">GeoNeuron</a> is a device that functions like a
				biological neuron in that it exchanges information between sensors,
				actuators, and a <a href="mission_control.html">data processing system</a>.</p>
			<p>GeoNeuron has two sets of registers, i.e., input registers and
				output registers. Input registers maintain the current state of
				connected sensors. Output registers keep the desired state of
				actuators (i.e., servos that control gymbals, winches, or sampling
				devices). During communication sessions, the content of the input
				registers is sent to the device “shadow” in the communication
				medium, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot">Amazon Web Services Internet of Things (AWS IoT)</a>,
				and the content of the output registers is received from the same
				source.</p>
			<p>Out of the box, GeoNeuron supports several types of water and
				air-quality <a href="sensors.html">sensors</a>. It also supports integration with <a href="https://www.campbellsci.com/dataloggers">Campbell
				Scientific dataloggers</a>, which can read a wide variety of measurement
				sensors.</p>
			<p>GeoNeuron uses the <a href="https://www.iridium.com/services/details/iridium-sbd">Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD)</a> satellite
				network for communication with the Internet. The Iridium SBD network
				was not designed to transmit large datasets, such as pictures or
				videos; rather, it is a simple and efficient network that provides
				the capability of transmitting short data messages, thereby truly
				providing global coverage.</p>
			<div
				class="w3-third w3-margin-right w3-padding-left w3-padding-top w3-padding-bottom w3-padding-right w3-right w3-border-grey">
				<b>AWS IoT is the spinal cord of the planet’s nervous system.</b>
				<img src="images/iot.png" alt="AWS IoT" style="width: 100%" />
			</div>
			<p>The AWS IoT communication medium is analogous to the spinal
				cord in a nervous system. It is used to exchange information between
				the “brain” and GeoNeurons, and it also triggers alerts, logs data,
				and routes the information flow in the system.</p>
			<p>Sometimes getting “there” requires too much time and money.
				And sometimes, it is not even know where the “there” actually is.
				This is when unmanned vehicles come into play.</p>
			<p>Envirover’s <a href="platforms.html#raider_2">unmanned surface vehicles (USVs)</a> and other mobile
				platforms are essentially GeoNeurons with propulsion and steering.
				These platforms have a guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C)
				system that also is known as ‘autopilot.’ Autopilot obtains the
				actual position, orientation, and velocity from the GPS,
				magnetometer, and inertial measurement unit, respectively, and
				controls the propulsion and steering to move to the desired point,
				follow the desired path, or “scan” the desired area. The autopilot
				also can perform sensor-based guidance, e.g., it can find places
				with the smallest/greatest readings of a certain sensor by using
				gradient-descent search.</p>
			<p>Multiple GeoNeurons or mobile platforms distributed over a
				certain area can be used to solve complex, data-collection problems.</p>
			<div
				class="w3-third w3-margin-right w3-padding-left w3-padding-top w3-padding-bottom w3-padding-right w3-left w3-border-grey">
				<b>ArcGIS is the brain of the planet’s nervous system.</b>
				<img src="images/arcgis.jpg" alt="ArcGIS" style="width: 100%" />
			</div>
			<p>The actual and desired states of GeoNeurons and mobile
				platforms can be synchronized with spatial databases in geographic
				information systems (GISs) on the web, such as <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/home/index.html">ArcGIS Online</a> or
				<a href="http://www.esri.com/en/arcgis/products/arcgis-enterprise/Overview">ArcGIS Enterprise</a>. The desired states of the devices can be changed
				by simply changing the attributes in a table. GIS can be used to
				store, visualize, and analyze the collected data and to control the
				data “collectors” with complex orchestration.</p>
			<p>In Envirover, we assess new ways of exploring our planet.
				Envirover’s mission is to make our planet smarter by providing
				next-generation, environmental intelligence solutions.</p>
